    title: "Three Good Friends",
    story: `They were good friends, but different otherwise. One of them was a musician, who practised both vocal and instrumental music. The second one was a mathematician, engrossed in calculations all the time.
    The third one was a philosopher, lost in thoughts of imaginary problems and their solutions.
    During the summer vacation, they set out on a camping trip to a hill resort. They divided the cooking chores among themselves. "I will fetch oil from the market," offered the philoshopher. "I cook excellent dishes," clamied the musician. "I know nothing about cooking. So I will advise you on how to take a proper bath," offered the mathematician.
    While bringing the oil, the philosopher was lost in a riddle: Is the oil in the bottle or the bottle in the oil? While debating the issue in mind he dropped all the oil on the ground. 
    The musician heard the sound of the boiling kettle. He thought it was not according to the <i>raga</i>. In anger he broke the unmusical kettle into pieces.
    The mathematician calculated the depht of the stream upto a distance and determined the average depth: less than one and a half metre. He invited his companions for a cool bath.
    All the three jumped in the water. Being poor swimmers, they were drowned.
    The average depth did not take into account the deep and shallow spots in the stream. Knowledge without experience has little value.`,

Roses are worth nothing." Jana did not retaliate. Next data Lara herself went out to meet the twelve months. She reached the clearing and saw the assembly of young and old ones. "Hey, October, give me a basket full of apples. And you April, I need water melons," she ordered as if they were her servents. Enraged by her stupidity, January roared. "Take it! Take it!."

One evening, taking a good look at the sea where he fished, he heard strange voices. It was as if a group of women was gossiping.
    He looked with amazement under the rock from where the cheery voices emanated. What caught his eyes made him catch his breath. Some arrestingly beautiful maidens were frolicking on the sea coast. They were seals who had cast aside their skins and enjoyed a sort of picnic on the shore.
    John tilted to the place of their rejoicing and picked up a seal skin. Alerted by his footsteps the lovely seals rushed for their skins and dived into the sea. As John was returning with his trophy, a seal skin, he heard someone sobbing.
    He looked back and saw a lovely maiden weeping. "Return my skin. I want to return to my sea." she begged. John did not relent. "You come with me. I will marry you and keep you in comfort," he replied.
    The helpless maiden had no choice. She began living with John. They had four children - two sons and two daughters. One day she was alone at home with one of their daughters. "Mother, I have seen a lovely seal skin concealed in a wooden chest in the barn," the daughter said in all innocence. "Show me! Show me!" Demanded the mother desperately. The daughter led her mother to the barn. Indeed, it was a lovely seal skin. The next moment she wore it and ran towards the sea. The surprised daughter followed her.
    "Good bye," she waved to her. "Tell your father, brothers and sister that I am going back home." She dived into the sea and swam out of sight. When John returned in the evening he heard about the happening of the day. But now there was no way to find the silky wife.`,

"Do not falter, however fierce the snow-storm may be. The sledge will lead you to the habitat of the Lord of the Wind. Appease him even if he insists on marrying you." The maiden followed the instruction. She braved the blinding blizzard on her way to the home of Lord of the Wind. The sledge stopped before the Lord's snowy palace. "Who are you?" Roared the apparently angry Lord of Wind. "I come from the clan of Eskimos. I am at your service," she bowed down and submitted.
    "Then cook a sumptuous dinner for me," he ordered. The maiden did as ordered. "Now go and distribute half of it to our old neighbour. Give her the food and bring back the plate," he said. She went out, but unable to proceed further due to the raging storm, threw the food and came back with the empty plate. "Show me the plate," Lord of the Wind demanded. When she showed it to him he flew into rage and tossed her on the snow.
    When the snow-storm did not calm down, a second maiden was despatched by the Eskimos to appease the Wind. She, too, was asked to prepare delicious food by the Lord. Then followed the order to give half of it to the old neighbour. She proceeded in the storm till she reached the igloo where an old woman received the food. She returned the empty dish.

    She lent her helping hand to pull Ankur up. Of same age, they instantly became friends. "Who are you?" Ankur asked. "I am a fairy. I live on the earth for a while and go back to my heavenly world."
    Then the fairy suggested, "Do you want to fly to my world?" "How can I?" Countered Ankur, "I have no wings." "If I kiss you, wings will grow on you," assured the fairy.
    The offer was fantastic: flying on wings with the fairy to the distant land of fairies. Ankur asked, "How soon can I be back on earth?" "Never," replied the fairy. "A winged person is not allowed to visit the earth."
    This was not acceptable to Ankur. So he bid goodbye to the fairy with a heavy heart.
    Back home Ankur was fast asleep. The fairy came and quietly sneaked into the room. She kissed his cheeks. Surprisingly her own wings dropped. She was now a little lovely girl like any other.
    The mother of Ankur found her. Her joy knew no bounds. At last Ankur had somebody to play with at home.`,

He bought a large fish and a rabbit from the market. Next day he asked his wife to accompany him to the field. "See this tree. It bears nuts," he pointed out to a tree. But down below he found a large fish.
    "A lucky day for us!" exclaimed the peasant. On the river-side, the peasant pretended to see if there was any fish in the net he had laid. "Oh it is a rabbit," he cried with joy, holding aloft a rabbit. Then he came to the bush. "See a bag there!" He pointed out.
    As they pulled out the bag it clinked with the sound of coins. "Oh! Good luck again!" They said and happily went home.
    The wife could not keep the secret. Soon the news reached the land-owner. The peasant and his wife were summoned. "Sir, we found it by good luck," she submitted. "First we found a rabbit in the fishing net, then a fish under a tree of nuts..." In the meantime, the peasant gesticulated behind her to indicate that she was crazy.

    title: "Hansel and Gretel",
    story: `Hansel and Gretel lived with their woodcutter father and father and step-mother at the edge of the forest. Though their fater was loving and caring, their step-mother tormented them. "The good-for-nothing boy and girl must earn their living themselves. We have no means to support them," complained the step-mother one night. "But they are too young. How will they manage ?" Father asked with concern.
    "Tomorrow we will leave them in the jungle. They will fend for themselves," replied the stepmother harshly. Next day, the parents asked the children to get ready for an excursion into the beautiful forest. Both children had overheard their step-mother's plan. Hansel had filled his pocket with pebbles. On their way to the forest they dropped them as they walked on.
    Once in the thick of the jungle, the step-mother said, "You take rest here my children. We will chop some wood." Tired of the long walk, they rested under the tree and fell asleep. When they woke up, it was dark. Their parents were out of sight. However, following the trail of pebbles they reached home. Father hugged them with pleasure and the step-mother frowned.
    On her insistence, again the scene was repeated the next day. The children were left in the dark jungle as the parents left stealthily. This time Hansel and Gretel had no indication to locate their home. So, they advanced further into the forest.
    Suddenly, they saw a strange house. It was made of all sorts of delicious sweets and savoury. The curious and hungry children ran into the house. An old, kind woman welcomed them. A sumptuous repast was served, which they ate with relish.
    "Thank you, madam," Hansel said, "Can we help you in the household chores?" "If you wish, clean up the cage there," she pointed towards the enormous cage. The moment Hansel entered to clean it up, the old woman closed the door. "Ha! Ha! I got you into the trap," she shrieked with delight. Both the children saw her changing into a hideous witch. "Now I will fatten the boy and roast him," she threatened. Gretel was made to sweep the floor and scrub the utensils at the witch's home.
    After a few days, the witch inspected the caged boy. "He is still lean, not good enough for roasting," she declared, "He will make better soup."
    Gretel trembled with fear. "Now you boil water in the pan," she ordered Gretel. "Lovely soup of human flesh and bones," She moistened her lips with her tongue and blurted out. Gretel followed the witch's command. As the water boiled she pushed her into the pan and held her tightly till she died.
    Freeing her brother from the cage, they set out for their home. They dismantled the house made of sweets and carried as much as they could for their parents and neighbours.`,
